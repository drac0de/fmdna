# Contactless Entry and Attendance System using Deep-Net Facial Recognition of Employees

I have added the face mask classification part of the project in this github repo on which I worked all by myself. Facial recognition was also implemented for the attendance of employees on which me and my team mate worked together. I will upload that code soon too.
